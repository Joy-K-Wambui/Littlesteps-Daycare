Introduction  
Welcome to the LittleSteps Daycare project! This project aims to streamline daycare management by providing an easy-to-use platform for attendance tracking, billing, event management, and communication between parents and staff. The LittleSteps Daycare system is designed to be intuitive, efficient, and user-friendly, catering to the needs of parents, caretakers, and staff.

Project Overview  
The LittleSteps Daycare project offers a comprehensive web application built using Java and FXML for the front-end, a MySQL database for data storage, and a structured back-end to handle interactions between the front-end and database. The application allows daycare staff to manage childrenâ€™s records, billing processes, events, and health records efficiently.

Technologies Used  
- Java: The primary programming language for back-end development.  
- FXML: User interface markup language used for building the front end.  
- MySQL: The relational database management system used to store and manage persistent data.  
- Gradle: For project management and build automation.  
- JavaFX: Framework for building rich desktop applications.  

Features  
- Attendance Tracking: Record and manage attendance for each child during the day.  
- Billing Management: Generate invoices, track payments, and manage due dates.  
- Event Management: Schedule, create, and manage events pertinent to the daycare.  
- Child Records: Maintain detailed records for each child, including health records and parental information.  
- Notifications: Send out communication to parents regarding important updates and messages.  
- User Roles: Manage different user roles (e.g., Admin, Staff, Parents) to restrict and allow access to various features and data.  

Database Structure  
The project is backed by a robust database structure consisting of the following tables:  
1. attendance: Tracks attendance records.  
2. billing: Handles billing information for daycare services.  
3. child_parent: Manages relationships between children and their parents.  
4. children: Contains records for children enrolled in the daycare.  
5. events: Stores details about daycare events.  
6. healthrecords: Maintains health-related records for children.  
7. invoice: Manages invoicing information.  
8. notifications: Facilitates notification management.  
9. parents: Stores details about parents/guardians of the children.  
10. staff: Manages information about staff members.  
11. tenants: Contains data for different tenants using the daycare service.  
12. users: Handles user authentication and roles.  

Each table includes various fields tailored to their functions, as described in the project context.
